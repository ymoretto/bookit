# bookit

Learning project of a booking management software for hotels

## Description

This repository is a workspace for a personal learning project in its early stages. The goal is to create a prototype for an internal hotel booking system, focusing on the user interface and core functionalities.

## Running the application

### Prerequisites:

Node.js (version 18.3 or higher) and npm installed on your system (https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/how-to-install-nodejs)

### Installation:

Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/ymoretto/bookit.git`
Navigate to the project directory: `cd bookit`
Install dependencies: `npm install`
Start the development server: `npm run dev (or yarn dev if using yarn)`

## Current Phase

### Mockup (Phase 1)

This initial phase involves creating mockups and wireframes using tools like Figma or Adobe XD to define the user interface layout, user flows, and information architecture for the internal hotel booking system.

- Search for available rooms
- View room details and photos
- Make a booking
- Manage existing bookings (cancel, modify)

#### Target Users

## Used Technologies

### Frontend

- Vue.js (JavaScript framework for building UI)
- Vuex (state management library for Vue.js applications)
- Vue Router (for handling routing and navigation)
- Custom UI components (developed from scratch with CSS)

### Backend

- Node.js (JavaScript runtime environment for server-side logic)
- Express.js (web framework for building APIs)
- MongoDB (document-oriented NoSQL database)

## Disclaimer

This project is currently under development for educational purposes and is not intended for production use.

## Roadmap

Develop a functional frontend prototype using Vue.js
Implement backend functionalities using Node.js (API development)
Integrate frontend and backend for a complete system (optional)

## Considerations

This will be my first time using MongoDB, but I'm interested in exploring its capabilities for this project.
