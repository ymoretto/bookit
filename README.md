BookIt - Hotel Booking Management System
This repository is a work in progress for a personal learning project. The goal is to develop a prototype for an internal hotel booking system, focusing on user interface and core functionalities.

Key Technologies:

Frontend:
Vue.js 3 (JavaScript framework for building UI)
Pinia (state management library for Vue.js applications)
Vue Router (for handling routing and navigation)
Custom UI components (developed from scratch with CSS)
TypeScript (for type safety) [New]
Testing:
Vitest (unit testing) [New]
Cypress (end-to-end testing) [New]
Code Quality:
ESLint (code linting) [New]
Prettier (code formatting) [New]
Backend:
Node.js (JavaScript runtime environment for server-side logic)
Express.js (web framework for building APIs)
MongoDB (document-oriented NoSQL database)
Current Phase: Mockup (Phase 1)

This initial phase involves creating mockups and wireframes using tools like Figma or Adobe XD to define the user interface layout, user flows, and information architecture for the internal hotel booking system.

Features:

Search for available rooms
View room details and photos
Make a booking
Manage existing bookings (cancel, modify)
Target Users:

Hotel staff responsible for managing bookings
Project Status:

This project is currently under development for educational purposes and is not intended for production use.

Roadmap:

Develop a functional frontend prototype using Vue.js 3 and TypeScript
Implement state management with Pinia
Implement unit tests with Vitest
Implement end-to-end tests with Cypress
Implement backend functionalities using Node.js (API development)
Integrate frontend and backend for a complete system (optional)
Considerations:

This will be my first time using MongoDB and TypeScript, but I'm interested in exploring their capabilities for this project.
Disclaimer:

This project is for educational purposes only.

Changes:

Updated the frontend technology section to include TypeScript.
Added sections for testing and code quality tools.
Additional Notes:

You can add a section for "Installation Instructions" or link to a separate document for detailed instructions.
Consider including screenshots of your mockups or wireframes to give users a better idea of the project's vision.
